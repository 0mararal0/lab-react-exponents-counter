## Introduction

In this lab, you will practice how to lift state up in React. You will work on a small React app that includes a Counter component and several other components that show different exponent values of a number (n², n³, n⁴, and n⁵). Your task will be to lift the state up so that all the components can share and access the same value through a common parent. Let's lift some state up! :muscle:
